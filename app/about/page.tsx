              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Founded in 2019 by visionary entrepreneurs Amos and Dineo Msiza, Amaqhawe Group Network (trading as
                Msiza Empire (Pty) Ltd) was born from a simple yet powerful vision: to ensure that every community,
                regardless of location, has access to reliable, affordable internet connectivity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Starting from humble beginnings, we recognized the critical gap in digital infrastructure across rural
                South African communities. What began as a mission to connect a few villages has grown into the largest
                ISP in the Thembsile Hani Municipality area, serving over 20 communities and thousands of households and
                businesses.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Today, we stand as a testament to what's possible when innovation meets community commitment. As a 100%
                Black-owned and BBBEE-certified company, we're not just providing internet servicesâ€”we're creating
                opportunities, fostering digital literacy, and building a foundation for economic growth in the
                communities we serve.
